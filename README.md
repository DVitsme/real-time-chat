# Real Time Chat

> A chat application that will update in real time when you make a post.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The Plan

1. Create a form that will take in a title + body.
2. Post will push to update state.
3. Hard code some chat messages in the state.
4. Loop over those messages with the ability to give them a star or a delete
5. Each message will be attached to a user and time stamped.
6. Each message will need a star counter
7. A user will only be able to star a message once.
